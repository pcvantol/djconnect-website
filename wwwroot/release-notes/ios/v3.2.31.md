# DJConnect App 3.2.31

## Changed

- Updated Music Discovery for the current backend feed contract: Discover now
  renders backend `sections[]` in order, supports `new_for_you` and
  `accepted_recommendations` without hardcoded section assumptions, and treats
  `revision` and `cache.hit` as metadata.
- Discovery cards are rendered only from backend-provided `sections[].items[]`;
  recent tracks, top tracks, Music DNA data, and previous UI cache are not
  reconstructed locally as recommendations.

## Fixed

- Music Discovery item decoding now tolerates new backend `kind` values so one
  newly introduced recommendation type does not break the feed.
