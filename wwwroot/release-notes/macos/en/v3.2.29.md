# DJConnect App 3.2.29

## Changed

- Apple clients now retain `ha_install_id`, `integration_version`, and optional
  `pairing_session_id` from Home Assistant pairing/status responses and send
  that metadata to Central without the APNs token.

## Fixed

- Watch push bootstrap recovery now goes through the iPhone proxy with the Watch
  identity, then retries Home Assistant exactly once with a Central
  `djcboot_...` proof.
- Central bootstrap errors such as `invalid_client_type`,
  `invalid_app_bundle_id`, `invalid_push_environment`, and
  `bootstrap_rate_limited` are now stored as privacy-safe status codes.
- Watch Track Insight now fills energy/detail metrics from nested backend
  payloads, and Music DNA no longer asks to activate again after it is already
  enabled.
